# Jup V4 DCA Bot 
This bot runs a simple dollar cost averaging strategy to buy assets over a period of time. It utilizes [Jupiter Aggregator](https://jup.ag), a swap aggregator on Solana using their SDK V4. It has built in rudimentary retry logic for failed transactions. 

This code was adapted from ARBProtocol's jup-dca-bot orginally written by [Jerald Tomada](https://github.com/jtomada/) and has been updated to experiment and learn. It has not been thoroughly tested and is unaudited. Please use at your own risk!

It is best practice **not to store tokens** on the wallet used with this bot apart from what is needed for swapping. Setting up a schedule to move tokens (not needed on the wallet) to a cold-storage hardware backed wallet (aka Ledger wallet) should be implemented to secure the DCA tokens being collected.

## Install
```
yarn install
```
## Configure
1. Create an `.env` file at the project root. See `.env-example`. 
Private key can be obtained from Phantom via Settings -> Export Private Key.

As the private key is stored in the .env file it is important to secure access to this file (on top of severly limiting funds stored on this wallet). Remove other/group access as a starting point to this file to only allow the owner and root user to be able to read the file (chmod 600 .env), use a secure password for the user for accessing the server it runs on and follow other best practices to reduce risk here including frequently moving swapped dca tokens to a hardware backed wallet.

2. Create your own `dcaconfig.ts`. See `dcaconfig-example.ts` for a template. 

Remove the entires you do not need from the sample file. Always start with a very small amount to see it is doing what is expected before you test further. Use at your own risk.

Note: the minimum interval is one minute.
## Run
```
yarn start
```
## Future Pending Improvements
- Improved error and transaction retry logic and validation on if the trade is worth executing (outside of Jupiter)
- Log to remote database for tracking
- Auto enable / disable and adjustments for timing & amounts based on custom trading approach ruleset(s)
